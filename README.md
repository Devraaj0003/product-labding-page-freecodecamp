A product landing page is a webpage designed to promote and sell a specific product or service. The landing page typically contains information about the product, such as its features and benefits, pricing, and customer reviews, along with a call-to-action (CTA) button that prompts users to take action, such as making a purchase or signing up for a trial.

To create a product landing page in HTML and CSS, you would typically start by structuring the page using HTML tags to define headings, paragraphs, images, and other content elements. You would also use HTML forms to collect user information, such as email addresses or shipping addresses, for example.

Next, you would use CSS to style the page, including the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual elements. You might use CSS frameworks or libraries, such as Bootstrap or Materialize, to help you create a consistent design and responsive layout that looks good on different devices and screen sizes.

Finally, you would add interactivity to the page using JavaScript or other front-end scripting languages to create dynamic elements, such as pop-up windows, animations, or interactive forms, that engage users and help them make informed decisions about whether to purchase the product or service.
